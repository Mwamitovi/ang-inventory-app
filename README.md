A Single-Page-App (SPA) to showcase Product Stock
=================================================

## SYNOPSIS

This is developed with the Angular framwork.
We can navigate a product list in a row format, as well as select individual products.
Project focuses on understanding the concept of "Components" in Angular.
This project was generated with [Angular CLI] version 6.1.1.
(https://github.com/angular/angular-cli)


## IMPORTANT

** You need, but are not limited to,
   - node v6.9.0 or higher (comes with npm)*
   - ES6(es2105)
   - TypeScript (version 2.7 or higher)(not strictly needed, but best to have)
   - Modern Browser (Chrome is recommended)


## GET - STARTED

### Assumptions
   - Configure your Version Control (Git-flow)
   - Fork the repository

### Configure

   - Locally, launch a new app within an empty project dir: `ng new <input-the-name>`
     For ease of git tracking, just use `ang-inventory-app` name. So simply run `ng new ang-inventory-app`

   - Launch the dev server: run `ng serve` to confirm that your app works,
     Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. 
     Note that the app auto-reloads as you make changes to the source files.

   - Include the product-related components: run `ng generate component <product-related>`.
     Do not edit any files as yet.

   - Run `git-flow init` within your local project to create the relevant work branches.
     Then `pull` the origin:develop -> your local:develop, 
     and merge the `changes` from the remote/origin.
     You can always run to safety, if you get lost! Run `checkout master`.

   - You can now edit, and explore the app further.
     These commands will come in handy:
       - Build: Run `ng build` to build the project. Add `--prod` for a production build.
         The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

       - Run unit tests: run `ng test` to execute the unit tests.

       - Runend-to-end tests: run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests
